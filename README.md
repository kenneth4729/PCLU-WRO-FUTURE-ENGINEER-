## 2.1 Our Autonomous car logic

## 2.2 Flow diagram

## 2.3 Why AISTEAM?
Our team decided to use AISTEAM because it is more compatible on the Vision Module/OpenMV camera as well as for the components of the AISTEAM that we use is light weight and versatile. AISTEAM provides us precise and accurate wide variety of components and sensors

## 3.2 Wiring diagram

## 3.3 Motor axle system
We use two ordinary motors, One motor is connected to the rear wheel this gives power and fast run to the robot. The other motor is connected to the steering system in front for it is important for the car to move forward and backwards and ensuring a smooth turn in curves. It improves the stability of our vehicle, which is important for tight corners.

## 3.4 Rack and pinion system
<img align="left" width="400" height="auto" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kenneth4729/PCLU-WRO-FUTURE-ENGINEER-/refs/heads/main/v-photos/Rack%20and%20pinion.jpg">
<h3>Our self driving car uses an Rack and pinion steering system which provides precise and stable controls for moving and turning. Itâ€™s a system that makes your car respond to every turn with precision, giving you the control you need to navigate the road safely. This system is use so our vehicle can turn on the corners smoothly and adjust itself back to the center of the track, with this kind of system our robot can turn on the tight corners a lot easier. </h3>

### 3.4.1 How the system works?
The rack and pinion steering system converts the rotational motion of your steering wheel into the linear motion needed to turn the car's wheel. This system is used to reduce the tires in slipping and prevents oversteer and understeer. Pressure must be constantly applied for the steering gear to be in contact with pinion bar.

# 4.0 Power management

## 4.1 Power source 
The battery powering our self-driving car is an rechargable Lithium battery module. Our self-driving car uses an Rack and pinion steering system which provides precise and stable controls for moving and turning. This system is used so our vehicle can turn on the corners smoothly with this kind of system. It makes our work a lot easier when turning.

## 4.2 Camera
For the camera, we used an OpenMV camera because it is more compatible for AISTEAM. The OpenMV camera is used to see and understand its environment, it helps to detect and avoid the green and red traffic obstacles. The camera can process the detection of the walls, lines and pillars  so it can move faster than it's normal speed.


# 5.0 Building the robot 

## 5.1 Base 
We specifically designed for a base that can be versatile, lightweight and sturdy to assure an efficient and reliable course with the self-driving robot. The base was created to be compact enough to fit regulations but light enough to be quick enough to run laps in a quick and efficient manner, through revisions and the such we ultimately found our base to be effective at the job at hand, modifications were made so it could hold all our components. This base was made so it can support the weight of the hub, sensors and other needs for our vehicle but light enough so it can still move fast.


## 5.2 Robot components
All the components are connected by pegs, no adhesives were used to set each component in place, some are more intricately fastened to stay put, examples are the Ordinary motor as we use it for steering, as well as the Encoder motor as we use it as the primary output for power to move the robot.

## 5.3 Wiring

# 6.0 Strategy

## 6.1 Walls 

## 6.2 Open challenge
For the open challenge we use the camera to detect the walls and lines with the help of the 180 ruder. The camera detects the walls and lines, once the robot is near the walls it will stop and the camera will turn left and right with the help of the 180 ruder. The reason why robot will need turn left and right is to detect if there's any wall on that area. If the robot didn't detect a wall on that area it will do an turn and move forward until it can detect another wall in front doing this logic until it finish 3 laps. Once the robot finish the 3 laps it will stop on the area where it starts.


## 6.3 Obstacle challenge
By the help of the camera we can detect the obstacles. Once the robot detects the obstacles like color green it will turn left and right for color red. This camera helps us to know the distance between our robot and the obstacle. When the robot detects the obstacle it will automatically turns to its corresponding turning position and align itself to the center. The robot will continue to run until it can detect another obstacle if the robot didn't detect any obtacle it will detect the walls instead.

# 7.0 Parking strategy
After completing the Three laps. Our robot begins the detection of the parking boundaries, the vehicle assess the available space and align it self with the detected area. If the robot commited the exact angle prior on the given parking space, the vehicle executes a parallel parking maneuver. The vehicle adjust its orientation to locate the exact parking area. Repeating this process until successful parking Achieved.
