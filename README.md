## 1.2 Team management

## 1.3 Reason to participate

# 2.0 About the car 

## 2.1 Our Autonomous car logic

## 2.2 Flow diagram

## 2.3 Why aisteam?
Because aisteam is more compatible on open MV Camera and the components of the aisteam is also light weight. Aisteam provides a precise and accurate wide variety of components and sensors. 

# 3.0 Mobility Management

## 3.1 Bill of materials

## 3.2 Wiring diagram

# 4.0 Power management

## 4.1 Power source 
The aisteam 

## 4.2 Camera
For the camera we use an open MV camera because it is more compatible for aisteam. This camera allows us to see and detect the walls and obstacles like red and green 

# 5.0 Building the robot 

## 5.1 Base 

## 5.2 Robot components

## 5.3 Wiring

# 6.0 Strategy

## 6.1 Walls 

## 6.2 Lines 

## 6.3 Open challenge
For the open challenge we use obstacle avoidant sensors to detect the inner and outer wall. Once the robot detetcs the walls it will calibrate the values of the walls and automatically move itself to the center.
The robot will run for three laps and stops on where it starts. This sensors helps the robot not to bump on the walls 

## 6.4 Obstacle challenge

# 7.0 Parking strategy

## 7.1 Open challenge video

## 7.2 Obstacle challenge video
