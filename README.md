## 1.2 Team management

## 1.3 Reason to participate

# 2.0 About the car 

## 2.1 Our Autonomous car logic

## 2.2 Flow diagram

## 2.3 Why aisteam?
Because aisteam is more compatible on open MV Camera and the components of the aisteam is also light weight. Aisteam provides a precise and accurate wide variety of components and sensors. 

# 3.0 Mobility Management

## 3.1 Bill of materials

## 3.2 Wiring diagram

## 3.3 Motor axle system

## 3.4 Rock and pinion system
Our self driving car uses an Rack and pinion steering system which provides precise and stable controls for moving and turning. This system is use so our vehicle can turn on the corners smoothly with this kind of system its makes our work a lot easier when turning.

### 3.4.1 How the system works?
The rack and pinion steering system converts the rotational motion of your steering wheel into the linear motion needed to turn the car's wheel. This system is used to reduce the tires in slipping and prevents oversteer and understeer. Pressure must be constantly applied for the steering gear to be in contact with pinion bar.

# 4.0 Power management

## 4.1 Power source 
The battery powering our self driving car is an rechargable Lithium battery moduelCOur self driving car uses an Rack and pinion steering system which provides precise and stable controls for moving and turning. This system is use so our vehicle can turn on the corners smoothly with this kind of system its makes our work a lot easier when turning.

## 4.2 Camera
For the camera we use an open MV camera because it is more compatible for aisteam. This camera allows us to see and detect the walls and obstacles like red and green
