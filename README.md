## 2.3 Why AISTEAM?
Because AISTEAM is more compatible on OpenMV camera and the components of the AISTEAM is also light weight. AISTEAM provides a precise and accurate wide variety of components and sensors

<h3>Our self driving car uses an Rack and pinion steering system which provides precise and stable controls for moving and turning. Itâ€™s a system that makes your car respond to every turn with precision, giving you the control you need to navigate the road safely. This system is use so our vehicle can turn on the corners smoothly and adjust itself back to the center of the track, with this kind of system our robot can turn on the tight corners a lot easier. </h3>
<br><br><br><br><br>

### 3.4.1 How the system works?
The rack and pinion steering system converts the rotational motion of your steering wheel into the linear motion needed to turn the car's wheel. This system is used to reduce the tires in slipping and prevents oversteer and understeer. Pressure must be constantly applied for the steering gear to be in contact with pinion bar.

# 4.0 Power management

## 4.1 Power source 
The battery powering our self-driving car is an rechargable Lithium battery module. Our self-driving car uses an Rack and pinion steering system which provides precise and stable controls for moving and turning. This system is used so our vehicle can turn on the corners smoothly with this kind of system. It makes our work a lot easier when turning.

## 4.2 Camera
For the camera, we used an OpenMV camera because it is more compatible for AISTEAM. The OpenMV camera is used to see and understand its environment, it helps to detect the green and red traffic obstacles.

# 5.0 Building the robot 

## 5.1 Base 
We specifically designed for a base that can be versatile, lightweight and sturdy to assure an efficient and reliable course with the self-driving robot.

## 5.2 Robot components
All the components are connected by pegs, no adhesives were used to set each component in place, some are more intricately fastened to stay put, examples are the Ordinary motor as we use it for steering, as well as the Encoder motor as we use it as the primary output for power to move the robot.

## 6.2 Open challenge
For the open challenge,

## 6.3 Obstacle challenge
In the obstacle challenge, we used an OpenMV camera. This helps us to detect the green and red obstacles. Once the robot detects an obstacle it will
